# What is `related_name` in Django?

If you're working with Django models and have come across `related_name`, you might wonder what it does and why it's useful. In this post, we’ll break it down for junior developers and show how it simplifies reverse lookups in Django.

## The Problem

When you define a `ForeignKey` in Django, it creates a backward relationship that allows you to access related objects. By default, Django names this reverse relation `<model>_set`. For example, if you have a `Post` model with a `ForeignKey` to an `Author` model, Django automatically provides a way to find all posts written by a specific author using `author.post_set.all()`.

But what if you’d prefer a more intuitive name or want to customize this behavior? That’s where `related_name` comes in.

## The Solution: Using `related_name`

The `related_name` attribute in Django allows you to customize the name of the reverse relation for a `ForeignKey`. This is helpful for readability and to avoid potential naming conflicts.

### Example Without `related_name`

Let’s consider two models: `Author` and `Post`.

```python
from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Post(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.title} by {self.author.name}"
```

If you wanted to find all posts by a specific author, you could use the reverse relation created automatically by Django:

```python
from myblog.models import Author

roo = Author.objects.get(name="Roo MacArthur")
roo.post_set.all()
<QuerySet ["Understanding Django", "Why Python Rocks"]>
```

This works, but the name `post_set` might not be intuitive or desirable in all cases. Additionally, if you’re working with multiple `ForeignKey` relationships, it can get confusing.

### Customizing with `related_name`

By setting `related_name` on the `ForeignKey`, you can define a more descriptive or meaningful name for the reverse relation.

```python
class Post(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="posts")
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.title} by {self.author.name}"
```

Now, instead of using `post_set`, you can use `posts`:

```python
>>> roo.posts.all()
<QuerySet ["Understanding Django", "Why Python Rocks"]>
```

This makes your code more readable and aligns better with natural language.

## Disabling Reverse Relations

If you don’t need a reverse relation, you can disable it by setting `related_name="+"`. This can save a bit of memory and avoid cluttering your model namespace.

```python
class Post(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="+")
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
```

Now, trying to access the reverse relation will result in an error:

```python
>>> roo.post_set.all()
AttributeError: 'Author' object has no attribute 'post_set'
```

## When to Use `related_name`

- **Improved readability**: Use `related_name` to give meaningful names to reverse relations.
- **Avoid naming conflicts**: If multiple `ForeignKey` fields point to the same model, customize `related_name` to avoid clashes.
- **Disabling reverse lookups**: Use `related_name="+"` if you don’t need the reverse relation.

## Conclusion

The `related_name` attribute in Django is a simple yet powerful tool that helps you control and customize reverse relationships in your models. By using `related_name`, you can write cleaner, more intuitive code and better organize your project.

If you're new to Django, experimenting with `related_name` in your models is a great way to understand its benefits. Try it out in your next project and see how it simplifies your queries!
